# Production Issue Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **Missing Preview Column in Supabase**: Added support for the `preview` field in the `conversations` table to store the last user message content
2. **Database Update Issue**: Fixed the `updateWhere` function to work with both SQLite (local) and Supabase (production) environments
3. **JSON Object Serialization Issue**: Fixed the handling of assessment_object to properly serialize and deserialize JSON data

## Fix Details

### 1. Missing Preview Column

- Added code to update the `preview` column in the conversations table whenever a message is added
- Modified the Vercel build script to ensure the `preview` column exists in Supabase

### 2. Database Update Issues

- Made the `updateWhere` function compatible with both SQLite and PostgreSQL by conditionally using `.returning()` based on what the database supports
- Added fallback logic to perform a separate query to get updated records when `.returning()` is not supported

### 3. JSON Object Serialization Issues

- Fixed the handling of the `assessment_object` field to properly serialize JSON in both SQLite and Supabase environments
- Added safety checks to prevent "[object Object]" string serialization issues
- Enhanced the JSON parsing functions to gracefully handle different data formats

## Deployment Instructions

1. Set the `DB_TYPE` environment variable to `supabase` in your Vercel deployment
2. Ensure the Supabase `conversations` table has a `preview` column of type `text`
3. Deploy the updated code to Vercel

## Files Modified

1. `backend/services/db-service/updateWhere.js` - Fixed the database update function
2. `backend/models/chat/message/1-user-message/add-message/database/sendUserMessage.js` - Added preview update
3. `backend/models/chat/conversation/create-new-conversation/database/conversationCreate.js` - Fixed JSON serialization
4. `backend/services/db-service/findByIdWithJson.js` - Improved JSON parsing
5. `backend/services/vercel-build.js` - Added checks and fixes for production environment

## Testing

All tests now pass locally, both unit tests and integration tests. The preview field is being properly populated and returned in the conversation history.
