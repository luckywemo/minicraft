/**
 * Assessment Integration Test Suite
 * 
 * This file serves as a simple entry point for the integration tests.
 * Each test pattern has been moved to its own file for better separation of concerns:
 * 
 * - RegularCycle.test.tsx - Tests the regular menstrual cycle path (O4)
 * - IrregularCycle.test.tsx - Tests the irregular timing pattern path (O1)
 * - HeavyFlow.test.tsx - Tests the heavy flow pattern path (O2)
 * - PainPredominant.test.tsx - Tests the pain-predominant pattern path (O3)
 * - DevelopingPattern.test.tsx - Tests the developing pattern path (O5)
 * 
 * Shared testing utilities are in test-utils.tsx
