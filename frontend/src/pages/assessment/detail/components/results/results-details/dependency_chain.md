### Context & State Management

1. `frontend/src/context/assessment/AssessmentResultContext.ts` - Defines the context interface and type structure
2. `frontend/src/context/assessment/AssessmentResultProvider.tsx` - Implements the context provider with reducer pattern for state management
3. `frontend/src/context/assessment/useAssessmentResult.ts` - Simple hook that provides direct context access with error handling

### Business Logic

4. `frontend/src/hooks/use-assessment-result.ts` - The main hook that:
   - Consumes the context through useAssessmentResultContext
   - Implements pattern determination logic
   - Generates recommendations based on assessment data
   - Handles session storage persistence
   - Transforms data for API submission

### UI Layer

5. `frontend/src/pages/assessment/results/page.tsx` - Results page component that:
   - Uses the assessment result hook for data access
   - Displays pattern information and recommendations
   - Provides user actions (save, share, chat)
   - Handles saving assessment results to database

### Data Flow

1. User input collected through assessment journey
2. Data persisted temporarily in session storage
3. Context provider maintains application state
4. Business logic in hooks processes the assessment data
5. UI components render the processed results
6. API requests transform data for backend storage when saved
