# Authentication Testing Strategy

This directory contains comprehensive tests for the authentication system in the Dottie application. The tests are organized into two main categories:

## Unit Tests

Located in the `unit` directory, these tests focus on individual authentication functions:

- **auth.test.ts**: Tests individual functions like login, logout, signup, and token refresh
- **jwtValidation.test.ts**: Validates JWT token structure, expiration, and integration with request interceptors

## Integration Tests

Located in the `integration` directory, these tests validate the end-to-end authentication flow:

- **authFlow.test.ts**: Tests the complete auth lifecycle from signup to login to token refresh to logout

## Security Considerations

These tests validate several important security aspects:

1. **JWT Token Validation**: Verifying token structure, expiration, and handling
2. **Auth Header Management**: Ensuring proper authorization headers are set and cleared
3. **Token Storage**: Testing secure token storage in localStorage
4. **Error Handling**: Validating system behavior during auth failures
5. **Session Management**: Ensuring proper login/logout flows

## Running Tests

To run all auth tests:
```
npm test -- "src/api/auth/__tests__"
```

To run a specific test:
```
npm test -- "src/api/auth/__tests__/unit/auth.test.ts"
```

## Future Enhancements

The following security enhancements could be implemented:

1. **Token Rotation**: Implement and test refresh token rotation for enhanced security
2. **CSRF Protection**: Add tests for CSRF token implementation
3. **Rate Limiting**: Test authentication rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
4. **Multi-factor Authentication**: Add tests for future MFA implementation
5. **Password Strength Validation**: Enforce and test password strength requirements
