# Playwright Testing in Dottie App

This document outlines the implementation of Playwright tests for the Dottie application's test page.

## Implementation Summary

1. **Configuration**: 
   - Configured Playwright to use Safari only (most difficult browser to configure)
   - Set up screenshot capturing on test completion
   - Configured test screenshots to be saved in the `test_screenshots` folder
   - Added the screenshot folder to `.gitignore` to prevent committing test artifacts

2. **Test Structure**:
   - Created end-to-end tests for the test page
   - Focused on verifying core UI elements are present
   - Implemented screenshot capture for successful test outcomes

3. **Test Documentation**:
   - Created README file in the test directory
   - Documented test approach and how to run tests

## Protected Screenshots

All test screenshots are saved to the `test_screenshots/test_page` folder, which is explicitly excluded from Git commits via the `.gitignore` file. This ensures that:

1. Test artifacts are available locally for developers to review
2. These artifacts do not bloat the repository
3. Screenshot evidence of test outcomes is preserved for reference

## Test Results

The tests verify:
- The page displays the correct environment heading ("DEVELOPMENT")
- The API test button is present and visible
- The SQLite test button is present and visible

Each successful test takes a screenshot of the verified state.

## Running the Tests

To run the tests:

```bash
npx playwright test
```

For debugging:

```bash
npx playwright test --debug
```

To view reports:

```bash
npx playwright show-report
```
