# step 1: extract screenshots from production and place in Figma

- WE ARE HERE

# step 2: port screenshots to Figma

- turn screenshots into editable Figma Files
- use a "component first" strategy that will reeuse components across multiple frames, with a focus on resusable components on a global and app level e.g. Navbar, chat sidebar.

# step 3: enhance design

- each contributor will work on their own "branch"
- this can be executed with parrellel branches workflow
- contributors can of course copy from other users' "branches"
